zipf analysis
=============

This repository contains code to observe whether books adhere to Zipf's law, as
done in support of the paper "Zipf analysis of 19th-century English-language books",
V. Dracula, to appear in Annals of Computational Linguistics, 2022.

To run the code, you will need the Pandas package installed.

To reproduce the figures in the publication, follow these steps:

1. Create a `results` directory

2. Use `countwords.py` to count the words in `frankenstein.txt`.

      python bin/countwords.py > results/frankenstein.csv

3. Use `plotcounts.py` to plot the resulting file.

      python bin/plotcounts.py

4. Save the plot as `results/frankenstein.pdf`.

5. Edit `bin/countwords.py` and `bin/plotcounts.py` to replace `frankenstein` with `dracula`.

6. Repeat the above instructions to generate `dracula.csv` and plot `dracula.pdf`.
